    "Create a script that can generate a fraction consisting of 10 unique digits on the numerator and 10 unique digits on the denominator that can be a close approximation of PI. So, each number (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,0) can and must only be used once in the numerator and once in the denominator. I.e. both numerator and denominator are a shuffle of \"1234567890\".\n",
